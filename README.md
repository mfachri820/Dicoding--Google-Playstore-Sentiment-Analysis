# Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository contains the final revised version of the Sentiment Analysis project completed for Dicoding.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment from text data using machine learning techniques. The model categorizes text into sentiment labels, helping to understand opinions and emotions expressed in the data.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction to improve model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implementation of classification algorithms to predict sentiment.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Data Visualization:** Graphical representations of results to interpret findings.

## Repository Structure
- `FinalRevisiSentimentAnalysisDicoding.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete workflow.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and usage instructions.

## Installation & Requirements
To set up the environment, install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib nltk
```

## How to Run
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `FinalRevisiSentimentAnalysisDicoding.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially.

## Results & Insights
- The final model achieved **high accuracy**, effectively classifying sentiment from text data.
- The project highlights the importance of **data preprocessing** and **model selection** in improving performance.
- Visualizations provide valuable insights into sentiment distribution and model behavior.
